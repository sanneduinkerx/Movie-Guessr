# Description 📋
For the course Real Time Web, I'm making a Real Time web app, as the name says. I will learn to work with websockets and real time data with multiple users at client side. 

## Concept ✏️
My idea is to make a Guessing game with movies. So there will be a chat available for the users to guess the movie. And my ultimate goal is that 1 user in the game room can see the movie poster and he/she types a hint, in total 3 hints. And the other users have to guess with the hints which movie it is. The hint can be an actor who plays in the movie, or a popular quote from the movie. Maybe later something with *firebase* to make rooms and all data.

A little sketch:

### Next steps:
My first step is to make **the chat** work so that I understand the websocket. And then to get data from an API, maybe IMDb or ThemovieDB. And load some data into the web app. After that i can begin adding more function to it if the main features work. Maybe first i will start with just a scene from a movie as image for all users to see and then everyone can guess from which movie it is. And if that works i can make it bigger.

### To Do:
- [ ] Chat function working
- [ ] Use insomnia to see how the API is structured
- [ ] Load API data in web app
