## Concept - Movie Guessr 🍿:
![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60745348/116361820-b03aa880-a801-11eb-9456-060a0ba71f2b.png)

With this real time web app you can play with friends, chat and guess which movie is displayed on the image. You can earn 10 points for every right answer and you can play with as many friends as you want. The first one to guess the movie wins the points!

### Features 🛠
- **Chat** function, to chat with the players
    - **Guess**, within the chat you can guess which movie is displayed
- A **Movie Scene** from TheMovieDB API to display a movie 
- **Point system**, to keep track of points earned
- **(Dis)connected**, See who joins and leaves the game

### Wishlist ❤️

#### Must have: 
- [X] Chat function with display name 
- [X] Guess correct movie with feedback
- [X] Show next poster/scene when answer is correct
- [X] Loading API data from TheMovieDB

#### Should have
- [X] Implement point system 
- [X] Message when someone connects or disconnects
- [ ] UI stack, error message + loading state
- [ ] I give up button to skip a movie

#### Could have 
- [ ] After someone reaches 500 points or so, show who won and start a new game
- [ ] fetch the next page with movies after being through all the movies in the array
- [ ] Use a database
- [ ] Different rooms

#### Would have
- [ ] User can choose how many rounds
- [ ] User can choose what kind of movies, personalize game
- [ ] All time score board

## Original plan 🎥
My original plan was to have different roles within the game. Like giving turns, one user gets to see the movie poster and has to describe with 3 hints to the other users what movie it is. The hint can be an actor who plays in the movie, or a popular quote from the movie. And then with the hints the other users have to guess in the chat. Therefore i wanted to make rooms and use a database. But given the limited time and because socket.io was new for me. I took a step back and chose for a guessing game where every client sees the same movie, but a backdrop image not the poster, because most of them had titles on it.

I also had other ideas:
- User gives emojis instead of hints, as hints so other users can guess the movie
- Just a scene from a movie or poster cover blurred and everyone guesses which movie it is, no different roles or turns
- *Completely different:* Shared booklist, everyone can give their review on the book they read, others can read the review

But i chose to go with the Movie Guessr game. 

## Data Life Cycle 🔄

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60745348/116053131-9cb10580-a67a-11eb-89bc-824234fac9c6.png)

## Real Time Events 💬
Real Time events i used with socket.io are:

### userConnected, to send feedback who connects
**Client**

` socket.emit('userConnected', username); `

**Server**

```
socket.on('userConnected', (userName) => {

    // send connected username to all clients, feedback who joined the game
    io.emit('userConnected', userName);
    
    // storing user data in users array to acces later
    users.push({
        username: userName,
        score: 0,
        // every client has a socket.id so i store the socket id together with the name
        id: socket.id
    });
})
```

### Message to send and receive messages for all clients.
**Client**

```
formChat.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
    if(input.value){
        // giving message plus display name and send with emit to server
        socket.emit('message', {
            username,
            msg: input.value
        });
    }
})
```

**Server**

```
socket.on('message', (chatMsg) => {
// emit message to all clients
io.emit('message', chatMsg);

    // check answer in chat message
    if(chatMsg.msg.toLowerCase().includes(sortedData[round].title.toLowerCase())){
        //feedback to all users, someone guessed it right
        chatMsg.username = 'gamehost';
        chatMsg.msg = `${user} guessed the right movie`;
        // send message that all clients, user guessed the right answer
        io.emit('message', chatMsg);
    }
}
```

### Scoreboard, to send and update scores of users
**Server**

```
 users {
            username: userName,
            score: 0,
            id: socket.id
        }

    // send users to clients to fill scoreboard
    io.emit('scoreBoard', (users));
```

**Client**

```
socket.on('scoreBoard', (users) =>{
    // empty the scoreboard to put all the new users in, 
    // and so that it doesn't pile up
    scoreEl.innerHTML = '';

    //for eacht user make list item with the username and score
    users.forEach(user => {
            const userScore = document.createElement('li');
            userScore.textContent = `${user.username} = ${user.score} points`
            score.appendChild(userScore);
    })
});
```

### userDisconnected, to send message to all, when someone disconnected.
**Server**

```
socket.on('disconnect', () => {
        let name = '';
        ...
        io.emit('disconnected', name)
})
```

**Client**

```
socket.on('disconnected', (name) => {
        const userDisconnect = document.createElement('p');
        userDisconnect.textContent = '${name} has left the game';
        messages.appendChild(userDisconnect);
})
```

### movieData, sending api image from TheMovieDB to all clients

**Server**

```
let guessMovie = {
        title: sortedData[round].title,
        img_path: sortedData[round].backdrop_path
    }
    
    io.emit('movieData', guessMovie);
```


**Client**

```
socket.on('movieData', (guessMovie) => {
    img.src ='https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/${guessMovie.img_path}'
})
```

## API 🍿
The API i use within this project is from [The MovieDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). This API has a wide range of get methodes to get data. You can request methodes from movies, tv shows, tv seasons or people. I chose to get requests from movies. The MovieDB has different GET methodes to use, for example:

- Get Latest
- Get Now Playing
- Get Top Rated
- Get Popular 
- Get Upcoming

I will be using the Get Top Rated methode. To see how the url and data can be used i used the application **Insomnia**. See [Data Model](#data-model), below. To see how the JSON file is displayed. The URL has an **endpoint**: *https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/top_rated*. You can also give a language, region and which page. To get images from the API i use the URL *https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/{poster-path}*. The poster path is in the JSON file with every object, if it has a poster path. Also the api does have a backdrop photo which is a scene from the movie and doesnt provide a title in the image. This i could use if i go back to a simple game where there are no roles.

### How to get API Key

To get an API key you have to register for an account first. Then in your account click API in the left sidebar, then click create and choose for what you are gonna use the API and then you can fill in the form for an API request. After that you can immediately use the API key.
