## Description
For the course Real Time Web, I'm making a Real Time web app, as the name says. I will learn to work with websockets and real time data with multiple users at client side. 

### First Concept
My idea for now is to make a Guessing game with movies. So there will be a chat available for the users too guess the movie. And my ultimate goal is dat 1 user in the game room can see the movie poster and he/she types a hint, in total 3 hints. And the other users have to guess with the hints which movie it is. The hint can be an actor who plays in the movie, or a popular quote from the movie. 

A little sketch for now: 





<!-- Here are some hints for your project! -->

<!-- Start out with a title and a description -->

<!-- Add a link to your live demo in Github Pages 🌐-->

<!-- ☝️ replace this description with a description of your own work -->

<!-- replace the code in the /docs folder with your own, so you can showcase your work with GitHub Pages 🌍 -->

<!-- Add a nice image here at the end of the week, showing off your shiny frontend 📸 -->

<!-- Maybe a table of contents here? 📚 -->

<!-- How about a section that describes how to install this project? 🤓 -->

<!-- ...but how does one use this project? What are its features 🤔 -->

<!-- What external data source is featured in your project and what are its properties 🌠 -->

<!-- This would be a good place for your data life cycle ♻️-->

<!-- Maybe a checklist of done stuff and stuff still on your wishlist? ✅ -->

<!-- How about a license here? 📜  -->
